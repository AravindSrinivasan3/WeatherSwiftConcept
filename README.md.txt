# WeatherSwiftConcept 

This repository outlines a **SwiftUI-based Weather App concept**, translated from an Android implementation.

###  Goal
Rebuild the core logic and architecture of an Android weather app using Swift and SwiftUI â€” prepared entirely on a Windows system without Xcode.

###  Whatâ€™s Inside
- `WeatherModel.swift` â†’ Codable models for OpenWeatherMap JSON  
- `WeatherService.swift` â†’ Network layer pseudo-implementation  
- `API_Plan.md` â†’ API strategy and parameters  
- `Mockup_UI.png` â†’ SwiftUI UI mockup

###  Future Vision
- Complete the UI in SwiftUI once a Mac is available  
- Publish the app to App Store under Swift Student Challenge

>  **NOTE:** This project simulates an iOS app without requiring Xcode or a Mac, showcasing project planning, API logic, and Swift fluency.
